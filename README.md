## C Raycaster

Currently this project is just a "fidget toy"/prototype and it isn't actually 2.5D yet.<br>
Currently it shoots one ray in a circle at the location of your mouse cursor.

If the ray is red, then it hasn't hit anything, if the ray is green then it has collided with a line.


You can **place a line by clicking twice**, the first click is the beginning location and the second click is the end location. Due to how the lines are stored (an array),
you cant place more then 100 lines :(

# What am I going to do next?

I'm going to make this project an actual 2.5D small tech demo with maybe portals and also make the code more robust and just better as I improve at C.
